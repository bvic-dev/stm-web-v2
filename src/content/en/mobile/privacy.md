## 1. Data Controller

The processing of personal data is handled by:

**Bily Victorien**  
Independent developer – Sole proprietorship  
34 Rue Bugeaud, 29200 Brest, France  
✉️ Contact: [b.vic.dev@gmail.com](mailto:b.vic.dev@gmail.com)

## 2. Data Collected and Purpose

The **Sport Track Merger** application **does not collect any identifiable personal data** from the user.

Data from the **Strava API** (activities, metrics, user ID) is only **stored locally** on the user's phone to allow **merging or duplicating** activities.  
> **None of this data is transmitted to a third-party server**, nor retained by the publisher.

Merged or duplicated activities are created locally, then **sent directly to Strava**. Generated files are **automatically deleted** after sending.

### Anonymous data collected:

- **Errors and crashes** (via Firebase Crashlytics): automatic collection, **not deactivatable**
- **User actions & performance** (via Firebase Analytics & Performance): **can be enabled/disabled** in the app settings
- **Hashed Strava ID** (non-reversible): used to associate a **Pro license** with an account

A secure authentication to Strava is managed via a **Firebase Cloud Function**:  
> It protects the API keys, **without processing personal data**.

## 3. Legal Basis for Processing

The processing operations in the app are based on:

- **The contract** between the user and the app to access Strava features
- **The user's explicit consent** for usage tracking (Analytics), **toggleable in settings**

## 4. Data Retention

- The publisher **does not store any personal data** on its own servers
- Only **anonymous technical data** is stored by **Firebase**, according to their retention policies
- Activity files are generated locally and **deleted from the device after use**

## 5. Distribution Platforms

The application is distributed via:

- **Google Play Store** (Google Ireland Ltd.)
- **Apple App Store** (Apple Inc.)

These platforms may collect usage and diagnostic data (installation, performance, etc.)  
> This data is **collected by Google or Apple**, with **consent given in the device settings**.

The publisher has access **only to anonymous and aggregated data**.

## 6. Third-party Services and Data Transfers Outside the EU

The app uses the following services:

- **Firebase (Google)**: crashes, performance, analytics  
- **RevenueCat**: in-app purchase management

> RevenueCat uses an **anonymous identifier** (derived from the hashed Strava ID) to link a license to a user.  
> No **identifiable personal data** is transmitted.

These providers may process data **outside the European Union**, using **standard contractual clauses** in compliance with the GDPR.

## 7. User Rights

In accordance with the **GDPR**, the user has the following rights:

- **Access, correction, and deletion** of local data (by uninstalling the app or logging out)
- **Revocation of Strava access** via the [dedicated Strava page](https://www.strava.com/settings/apps)
- **Objection to analytics tracking** via the app settings
- **Contact the controller**: [b.vic.dev@gmail.com](mailto:b.vic.dev@gmail.com)

## 8. Target Audience

The app is reserved for users eligible for a **Strava account**, meaning:

- **At least 13 years old**, or the minimum age required in their country of residence

## 9. Policy Updates

This policy may be **modified at any time**.  
Any updated version will be published in the app or on the official website.

> The user is encouraged to regularly review the latest version available.
