            },
            {
                "question": "What is the difference between the free version and the Pro version?",
                "answer": "The free version allows you to merge up to 2 activities, twice a day. The Pro version offers unlimited merges, full customization (title, description, activity type, etc.), and access to more than your last 50 activities."
            },
            {
                "question": "Do I need a credit card to activate the trial version?",

                "question": "I’m changing phones. Will I lose my Pro version?",
                "answer": "No, your Pro purchase is linked to your Strava account. Just log in with the same account on your new phone to restore your Pro access at no extra cost."

            {
                "question": "Can I merge an activity with GPS data on one side and heart rate on the other?",
                "answer": "Yes, Sport Track Merger can merge overlapping activities, for example to combine GPS data with heart rate or power sensor data."
            },
            {
                "question": "How does activity duplication work?",
                "answer": "You can duplicate an existing activity by choosing a new date and time. This is useful for correcting a recording error, for instance."

                "question": "Can I recover my GPX or TCX file after merging?",
                "answer": "The app automatically deletes GPX or TCX files from your phone after merging to save space. However, you can always export the merged activity from Strava."

            {
                "question": "Why does my merged activity show more distance than the total of the originals?",

            },
            {
                "question": "Why is my merged activity marked as a 'Workout' on Strava?",
                "answer": "The free version does not allow editing the activity type. With the Pro version, the activity type is automatically set based on the merged activities."
            },
            {
                "question": "My new Strava activity shows incorrect PRs. What should I do?",
                "answer": "Make sure you deleted the original activities after merging. If PRs are still wrong, click 'Recalculate Efforts' in the Strava app."
            },
            {
                "question": "Why does the app request access to my Strava activities?",
                "answer": "The app needs access to your Strava activities to read, merge, and create new ones. No data is sent to external servers — everything is handled locally on your device."
            },
            {
                "question": "How is my personal data handled?",
